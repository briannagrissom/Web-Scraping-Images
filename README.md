# Web-scraping Images
Web-scrape crocodile images to use for an image classification project.

Includes:

1) Loading the website's HTML into a Python variable through the requests library.
2) Using XPATH/CSS through a scrapy Selector to extract URLs for the images.
3) Filter the URLs through a for loop to ensure the URLs contain images only.
4) Use the urllib package within a for loop to quickly and efficiently download the image links to a specified folder.
